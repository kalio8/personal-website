## About Me

I am currently a fourth year student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) working to obtain my BS in Statistics and Data Science. Throughout my coursework and projects I've strengthened my abilities in cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and interpreting data to support data-driven decisions. I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and am eager to apply my skills in practical and impactful ways.
