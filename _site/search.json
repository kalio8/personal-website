    "text": "Introduction\nThe WiDS Datathon Global Challenge 2025 focuses on leveraging data science to understand neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly ADHD, and their differences across sexes. Our team participated in this challenge to develop a multi-outcome model that predicts both an individual’s sex and ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging and socio-demographic data. By analyzing brain activity patterns, emotions, and parenting influences, we aimed to uncover sex-specific differences in ADHD presentation. Our findings contribute to the broader goal of improving early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for individuals affected by ADHD."

With the recent transition from Pirelli to Hankook tires in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo series, our team analyzed how this change impacted race performance. By examining lap time data and other fetaures from multiple racing seasons, we assessed the effects of tire degradation and overall performance differences between Pirelli and Hankook. Our analysis provids insights into how tire type influence speed and durability, particularly under varying weather and track conditions."
