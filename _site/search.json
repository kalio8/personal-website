    "text": "Introduction\nThe WiDS Datathon Global Challenge 2025 focuses on leveraging data science to understand neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly ADHD, and their differences across sexes. Our team participated in this challenge to develop a multi-outcome model that predicts both an individual’s sex and ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging and socio-demographic data. By analyzing brain activity patterns, emotions, and parenting influences, we aimed to uncover sex-specific differences in ADHD presentation. Our findings contribute to the broader goal of improving early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for individuals affected by ADHD."

With the recent transition from Pirelli to Hankook tires in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo series, our team analyzed how this change impacted race performance. By examining lap time data and other features from multiple racing seasons, we assessed the effects of tire degradation and overall performance differences between Pirelli and Hankook. Our analysis provides insights into how tire type influence speed and durability, particularly under varying weather and track conditions."

    "text": "Methods\nThe data sets were cleaned, feature engineered, and merged to create a unified dataset, with a new column added to classify the tire types (Pirelli or Hankook). For race lap times, a factorial block design was used, blocking by the year of the race and incorporating statistical tests such as ANOVA and variation inflation factor to assess factors influencing tire performance.\nFor the race lap time analysis, we used a factorial block design to account for variations across different race years. This approach helped us examine how different factors, such as tire type and race conditions, influenced lap times while controlling for year-to-year differences in track conditions and crashes. By blocking on the year of the race, we ensured that comparisons between the two tire types were made within the same set of race conditions, minimizing potential biases.\nThe factorial design allowed us to look at the interaction effects between multiple factors, such as tire type and lap number, which could influence tire degradation and overall performance. We used ANOVA tests to determine whether differences in lap times could be attributed to the tire type while considering the variability introduced by the race year and other conditions. The ANOVA results showed that tire type was indeed a significant factor, and Hankook tires performed better in terms of durability, as reflected by more consistent lap times throughout the race.\nWe also calculated the variation inflation factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity among the predictor variables. This was an important step, as multicollinearity could distort the results and make it harder to determine which factors were truly affecting tire performance. By checking the VIF, we ensured that the factors in our model were not highly correlated with each other, allowing for a clearer understanding of how tire type, track conditions, and other variables contributed to the differences in race lap times."

    "text": "Results\nFor race durability, the results showed that Hankook tires performed better than Pirelli tires in terms of overall durability, with statistically significant findings. The analysis of different sectors (S1, S2, S3) on the track indicated that tire type, track temperature, lap number, and interactions between lap number and tire type all played significant roles in tire performance. Sector one, with heavy acceleration and braking, was particularly sensitive to tire type, while sector two showed significant interactions between tire type and lap number. The variability in lap times for Hankook tires was higher than for Pirelli tires, which could be attributed to factors such as changing race conditions, but overall, Hankook tires demonstrated less degradation over the course of the race. In our binary varaible Tire Type, Hankook = 0 and Pirelli = 1. The model’s coefficient for tire type, which was 0.07, indicates that switching from Pirelli to Hankook is associated with a decrease in lap time by approximately 0.07 seconds, suggesting that Pirelli tires may have contributed to slower lap times compared to Hankook tires in this analysis."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nSeveral limitations impacted the robustness of our findings in this project. First, the data available was limited to only two races per tire type, which restricted our ability to draw strong, reliable conclusions about the relationship between tire types and lap times. A larger dataset would have enhanced the confidence in our results. Additionally, the small sample size made our analysis more vulnerable to biases and variations caused by factors such as track temperature or course repaving. The driver also played a significant role, as the data included multiple drivers, each with unique performance characteristics, which could influence lap times independently of the tire type used. Also, the recent transition from Pirelli to Hankook from 2022 to 2023 may have introduced a learning curve for drivers, which could have affected performance during the early stages of adaptation.These factors introduced potential inconsistencies into our analysis."
